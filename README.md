Do some simulations on NAPA pool league lagger's choice matches

Change some variables when running.
1. opponent = str("The opponent team name as it appears in the website")
1. us = str("Our team name as it appears in the website")
1. division = int(division id)
1. simulation_count = int(iterations of simulated games, more simulations better accuracy, fewer simulations faster simulations)
